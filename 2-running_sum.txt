Calculate a running sum


Step 1: Start


Step 2: Enter value of N


Step 3: Initialise n is equal to N
            SUM is equal to 0
Step 4: while n is greater or equal to 0(n>=0)
             SUM is equal to SUM + n
             INPUT value of N
             Initialize n is equal to N (n = N)
Step 5: Exit the program when n is not greater or equal to 0
Step6: Print SUM
step 7: End
