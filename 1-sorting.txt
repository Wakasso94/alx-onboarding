Reads in three numbers and writes
them all in sorted order


Step 1: Start


Step 2: Enter an integer value: a, b and c


Step 3: Initialise a, b, c with 
                      a is equal min
                      b is equal mid
                      c is equal max
Step 4: IF min is greater than mid
                 Then mid is equal to a and min is equal to b
             ELSE IF min is not greater than mid go to the next condition
             IF mid is greater than max
                   Then max is equal to mid and mid is equal to c
             ELSE IF mid is not greater than max go to the next condition
             IF min is greater than mid
                   Then mid is equal to min and min is equal to c
Step 5: Print max, mid, min


Step 6: Exit the program
